# Student Record Management System

A robust, CLI-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed in **Java**. This project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and efficient data management using the Java Collections Framework.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Persistent Data Handling**: Manage student records dynamically using `ArrayList`.
* **Search Functionality**: Efficiently locate records via unique Student IDs.
* **Input Validation**: Built-in buffer clearing and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.
* **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns between the Data Model (Student) and the Logic Controller (Student_Record).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language**: Java (JDK 8 or higher)
* **IDE**: VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA
* **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

**💻 Implementation Details**
The system utilizes several core Java concepts:
Encapsulation: Using classes to bundle data (id, name, marks) and methods.
Collections Framework: Leveraging ArrayList for dynamic memory allocation.
Control Flow: Implementing do-while loops and switch-case blocks for an interactive CLI.
